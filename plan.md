# Which students perceive REBOUND as helpful, and how do unit and session differences support (equate to ) perceived helpfulness of each REBOUND component (content, facilitator, and class structure)?
# Is higher perceived helpfulness of REBOUND associated with better final outcomes (final mark or improvement)
# Do repeating students differ from non-repeating students in (a) perceived helpfulness, (b) satisfaction, and (c) reported challenge types/comments—and are these differences consistent across units and sessions?
# How do reported challenges (content/staff/other + themes from comments) relate to REBOUND perceptions and outcomes, and do these relationships differ by unit/session?
